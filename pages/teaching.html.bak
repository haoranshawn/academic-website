                                    Since joining Bradley, I have taught a total of <strong>50</strong> class sections (excluding independent study). This includes three overloaded semesters, each with four courses and three different preparations. The average class enrollment is <strong>18</strong> students. Among the courses listed here, <em>Introduction to Business Analytics</em> (MIS 173) and <em>Business Analytics¹</em> (MIS 272) were existing courses at Bradley. I was able to prepare for and learn these courses with the support of Dr. Paul Stephens.

                                    This line chart compares undergraduate and graduate enrollment trends over the years. In response to enrollment challenges, Bradley launched several new graduate programs in 2022. To support this initiative, I was among the first faculty members to contribute, participating in the development and teaching of the <em>Data Science Program</em>, which launched in 2023 within the Foster College of Business. A year later, I also joined efforts to build the <em>Master of Accounting Program</em>, which launched in 2025. With a third major on the horizon, I remain fully committed to supporting and contributing to Bradley's future in any way I can. As a result, teaching has taken around 70% of my time and 15% for research, 15% for service in most semesters.

                                    Recognizing that teaching excellence has always been a cornerstone of the Bradley brand, my goal has remained steadfast: to maintain and excel in undergraduate education while ensuring that graduate students receive an experience aligned with the expectations of advanced study. However, I encountered unprecedented challenges in the graduate program, particularly with cross-listed courses, where both undergraduate (UG) and graduate (GR) students are enrolled in the same section. One of the most significant drawbacks of this arrangement is the substantial gap between Bradley-trained UG students and international GR students in areas such as knowledge, skillset, cultural background, and academic norms. This disparity has negatively impacted on my ability to maintain the same level of engagement and expectations across both student groups. To address this challenge, I proposed a solution to separate UG and GR courses, provided that enrollment numbers align with Bradley's requirements. This approach necessitated multiple changes, including 1. Teaching methodology adjustments – shifting from an algorithmic approach for UG students to a heuristic approach for GR students 2. Content modifications – transitioning from primarily instructional content to materials that encourage critical thinking and 3. Cultural and behavioral adaptations – addressing challenges such as class time conflicts with region-specific practices, differences in academic integrity (e.g., plagiarism concerns), attendance expectations, and communication styles.

                                    Significant efforts have been devoted to overcoming these challenges. Beyond course-related modifications, I regularly attend <em>graduate teaching faculty meetings</em> each semester, participate in <em>group learning sessions</em> with experienced faculty such as Dr. Mary Conway Dato-on on <em>international student education</em>, contribute to the <em>development of comprehensive exams</em>, and engage in various initiatives to enhance <em>graduate learning experience</em>. While these challenges required substantial adaptation, they have also provided opportunities for growth. These experiences have not only made me a more effective educator but have also broadened my perspective as a professional.

                                            Blight has plagued Peoria's struggling neighborhoods for years, and this capstone project aimed to analyze and address the issue. The student team aggregated data from Peoria Cares service requests, demolition records, and socioeconomic metrics to map the ripple effects of urban decay. Their objective was to understand the relationship between abandoned properties, crime, and economic decline while proposing actionable solutions for city leaders.

Rather than simply identifying problems, the team created a citywide blight "scorecard" to help officials prioritize interventions. As their mentor, I guided them in refining their research questions, validating data sources, and ensuring their findings resonated beyond academia. Through iterative discussions and data analysis, they successfully connected quantitative insights with real human stories, advocating for more equitable urban policies.

One student even developed a mock city budget, demonstrating how reallocating existing funds could make these ideas feasible. I challenged the team to critically evaluate their assumptions, asking questions such as, "Do amenities drive growth, or do thriving areas naturally attract them?" This push for rigor helped them produce a report that balanced ambitious vision with practical implementation.

                                    I still remember the first time I taught MIS 173 in the basement of Markin and was
                                    mistaken for one of the students rather than the professor. To combat this and boost my
                                    confidence, growing a mustache became a permanent part of me. That experience was an
                                    early lesson in the importance of presence and self-assurance in the classroom, shaping
                                    how I approached teaching and interaction with students.
                                </p>

                                    Throughout my teaching career, I have come to understand that true teaching extends far
                                    beyond delivering content. It is a process of continuous refinement, adaptation, and
                                    engagement. Over the years, my teaching philosophy has evolved from focusing on
                                    fundamental instructional techniques to fostering an environment where students not only
                                    gain knowledge but also develop confidence in applying what they learn. My approach is
                                    centered on passion for the subject, deep care for students' learning experiences, and an
                                    emphasis on critical thinking and practical application.
                                </p>
                                
                                <p class="mb-4">
                                    I firmly believe that an instructor's enthusiasm for their subject matter is contagious.
                                    When students see their instructor deeply engaged, they are more likely to develop an
                                    intrinsic motivation to learn. My early teaching experiences reinforced this notion, and I
                                    have since committed to making my classes dynamic and relevant. In courses such as
                                    Business Analytics and Information Systems, where students often perceive the material
                                    as technical or rigid, I work diligently to bring concepts to life. Through real-world case
                                    studies, hands-on projects, and industry applications, I help students see the direct impact
                                    of what they are learning. For example, in my Business Analytics courses, I integrate
                                    datasets from real-world scenarios such as urban development data from the City of
                                    Chicago to illustrate the practical applications of analytics tools. This approach has been
                                    particularly effective in bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical
                                    implementation. Student feedback consistently highlights that working with real data
                                    enhances their learning experience, making abstract concepts more tangible and
                                    meaningful.
                                </p>

                                    Beyond delivering content, I believe in fostering a supportive and inclusive learning
                                    environment. Each student enters the classroom with a unique background, level of
                                    preparedness, and set of challenges. My role is to meet them where they are and provide
                                    the resources and guidance necessary for their success. Over time, I have refined my
                                    approach to be more student-centered, incorporating flexible learning methods such as
                                    recorded lectures, individualized tutoring sessions, and iterative feedback loops. A pivotal
                                    moment in my growth as an educator came when I recognized the vast differences in
                                    Excel proficiency among students in my introductory courses. To address this, I began
                                    offering informal tutoring sessions outside class hours, including weekends. These
                                    sessions not only helped struggling students build foundational skills but also created a
                                    sense of community and mentorship. By actively listening to students' concerns and
                                    adjusting my approach based on their feedback, I have cultivated an atmosphere where
                                    students feel seen, heard, and supported in their learning journey.

                                    One of the most rewarding aspects of teaching is witnessing students develop confidence
                                    in their ability to solve complex problems. My teaching methodology has evolved to
                                    emphasize experiential learning, encouraging students to think critically and apply
                                    concepts in meaningful ways. Open-ended assignments, student-led discussions, and
                                    collaborative group projects have become key components of my courses. For instance,
                                    in my Business Analytics Software and Applications course, I introduced a "News and
                                    Stories" segment where students lead discussions on current events in the tech and
                                    analytics world. This initiative has significantly increased engagement by allowing
                                    students to draw connections between coursework and real-world trends. Similarly, I
                                    have integrated certification preparation, such as RapidMiner training, to give students a
                                    competitive edge in the job market. By embedding industry-relevant skills into the
                                    curriculum, I ensure that students leave my courses not only with theoretical knowledge
                                    but also with practical competencies that enhance their career prospects.
                                </p>

                                    Teaching is an iterative process, and my philosophy has matured through constant
                                    reflection and adaptation. Early in my career, I focused primarily on content delivery, but
                                    as I gained experience, I recognized the importance of adaptability, student engagement,
                                    and real-world application. Feedback, both from students and self-evaluation, has been
                                    instrumental in shaping my approach. I have learned to balance structure with flexibility,
                                    theory with practice, and rigor with support. As I continue my journey as an educator, I
                                    remain committed to fostering an environment where students not only learn but also
                                    develop the confidence to apply their knowledge. By integrating technology, real-world
                                    data, and industry connections into my teaching, I strive to make learning relevant,
                                    engaging, and impactful. Above all, I see teaching as a partnership, one where both
                                    instructor and students grow together in the pursuit of knowledge and meaningful
                                    application.

                                        When I began teaching MIS 173 in fall 2018, I faced a blank slate with no established structure, no precedent, just an opportunity to build something meaningful from the ground up. The challenge was clear: create a course that balanced technical skills with strategic business insights. I built the foundation by integrating a mix of hands-on tools such as Excel, RapidMiner, and Tableau, alongside emerging topics like blockchain, data security, and systems analysis. Early assignments focused on database queries and data visualization, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical applications.

                                        However, as the course developed, student feedback revealed key areas for refinement. Some students struggled with the pace, while others desired more real-world applications. Adjustments were necessary to strike the right balance.

                                        By spring 2020, I refined the course by strengthening conceptual mastery while reinforcing technical skills. However, problems remained: challenges slower learners felt tedious, while a faster pace left some students overwhelmed. Then came fall 2020 and the pandemic, which forced an abrupt transition to online learning. Engagement became the new challenge: how would I keep students motivated in a remote setting? I experimented with interactive virtual sessions to maintain engagement, flexible deadlines to accommodate varying learning paces, and asynchronous assignments for self-paced learning. One unexpected breakthrough was lecture recording, initially a necessity, but they soon became invaluable tools for self-guided review, transforming the learning experience. By fall 2021, further feedback led to another major shift—students overwhelmingly finding the textbook unhelpful. In response, I made it optional, replacing it with curated materials and applied projects.

                                        After stepping away from MIS 173 for some time, I returned in fall 2024 with a new initiative, migrating the course to MindTap, an interactive platform with real-time progress tracking and modular learning components. This move provided students with a structured and cohesive experience, making it easier for diverse learning styles to thrive. With each iteration, MIS 173 has evolved—not just in content, but in how it supports different learners, ensuring they gain both technical proficiency and strategic insight.

                                        Unlike MIS 173, my journey with MIS 272 was unexpected. I inherited the course on short notice due to an urgent departmental need, which meant stepping in with minimal lead time. With no prior experience teaching it, I had to simultaneously learn, develop course materials, and deliver content. This baptism by fire proved to be an invaluable learning experience.
                                    </p>

                                        The course focuses on advanced business analytics techniques, including data mining, predictive analytics, and data visualization. I developed a comprehensive curriculum that covers both theoretical foundations and practical applications of these techniques. The course is designed to help students develop advanced analytical skills, critical thinking, and problem-solving abilities.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="mb-3">
                                        To ensure student engagement and motivation, I incorporated various interactive elements, such as group discussions, case studies, and hands-on projects. These activities allowed students to apply theoretical concepts to real-world problems, fostering a deeper understanding of the material. Additionally, I provided regular feedback and encouragement, helping students to stay on track and build confidence in their abilities.

                                        Throughout the course, I emphasized the importance of ethical considerations in business analytics. I encouraged students to think critically about the potential consequences of their actions and to consider the impact of their decisions on stakeholders. This helped to develop their moral compass and prepare them for the challenges of working in a rapidly changing business environment.
                                    </p>

                                        Overall, my experience teaching MIS 272 was highly rewarding. I was able to help students develop advanced analytical skills, critical thinking, and problem-solving abilities, while also fostering a deeper understanding of the importance of ethics in business analytics. The course was well-received by students, and I received positive feedback on my teaching style and the course materials.
